# GymCore - Gym Progress Tracker

GymCore is an advanced application for tracking gym progress, workouts, repetitions, sets, and weights lifted. It has been developed using cutting-edge .NET technology and serves as the backend for the GymCoreApp frontend application (https://github.com/jakubmorawski8/GymCoreApp.git).

## Key Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I have acquired valuable skills in .NET programming and demonstrated proficiency in the following areas:

### Asynchronous Programming
Creating applications using asynchronous programming, optimizing performance, and responsiveness.

### Clean Architecture
Implementing Clean Architecture principles, which involve designing a well-structured project with isolated layers, utilizing Mediator and CQRS patterns, and employing Dependency Injection (DI) for maintainable and scalable code.

### Entity Framework
Using Entity Framework for efficient data access and database interaction, including code-first development, LINQ queries, database migrations

### Unit and Integration Testing
Developing comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application.

### Microsoft Identity for Authentication
Implementing secure user authentication using Microsoft Identity, ensuring data privacy and protection.

### REST API Design
Creating a robust and user-friendly REST API to facilitate seamless communication between the backend and frontend.

### Error Handling and Exception Management
Implementing effective error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to users.

### Git Version Control
Collaborating with a team member on this project allowed me to learn the ins and outs of version control using Git. We leveraged Git Flow practices, including feature branches, pipelines, pull requests, and other valuable features.
